# rest980
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/koalazak/rest980.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/koalazak/rest980)

rest980 create a http server to map all [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) methods in a REST API to control your iRobot Roomba 900 series 980 / i7 / i7+ via HTTP requests.

## Build
You can build the package for a specific architecture. Possible values are `armhf`, `arm64`, `amd64` and `i386`. 
```bash
$ dpkg-buildpackage -a armhf -us -uc -b
```

## Install
```bash
# dpkg -i rest980_2.1.0~ado1_armhf.deb
```

## Configuration
The configuration file is in `/etc/rest980.conf`.

|Property|Default|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|ROBOT_IP| |*(optional)* Set if you know your robot IP to skip discovery and speed up startup|
|BLID| |*(required)* The Roomba blid.|
|PASSWORD| |*(required)* The Roomba password|
|FIRMWARE_VERSION|2|*(optional)* Set to 1 or 2 depends of your robot firmware version. Use `2` for any firmware >=2 (yes, use 2 if you have firmware version 3).|
|ENABLE_LOCAL|yes|*(optional)* Set to 'no' if you want to disable local API.|
|ENABLE_CLOUD|no|*(optional)* Set to 'no' if you want to disable cloud API.|
|KEEP_ALIVE|yes|*(optional)* Set to 'no' if you want to connect and disconnect to the robot in each request (slow but leave the connection free for the official mobile app).|
|SSL_KEY_FILE| |*(optional)* Set path to key file to enable HTTPS. Both key and cert must be set. [(how to create self signed cert)](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html)|
|SSL_CERT_FILE| |*(optional)* Set path to cert file to enable HTTPS. Both key and cert must be set. [(how to create self signed cert)](http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html)|
|PORT|3000|*(required)* The HTTP port to listen on|

*See [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) for more information and instructions for obtaining your robot blid and password*

## Firmware version

[Check your robot firmware version!](http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/529) and set your firmware version in `firmwareVersion` rest980 configuration!

## Service
To enable `rest980` on reboot:

    # systemctl enable rest980
    
To start and stop the service:

    # systemctl start rest980
    # systemctl stop rest980

## API documentation

Now you can make request to this server on port 3000.
There are 2 main endpoints: `local` and `cloud`, mapped to [dorita980](https://github.com/koalazak/dorita980) local and cloud methods as well.

## Error responses:
HTTP status 500 and response:
```
{"message":"human message","error":{}}
```

## Local

### Actions

All cleaning actions are under `/api/local/action/[action]` endpoint using GET method  without query params:

Available actions:

- start
- stop
- pause
- dock
- resume
- cleanRoom

Example: start to clean

```http
GET http://192.168.1.110:3000/api/local/action/start
```
Success Response:
```
{"ok":null,"id":23}
```

Example: clean a specific room

Some roomba types support "room specificic cleaning" - at the time of writing, at least the s9 and the i7 support this featrue. Assuming you have this model, and have a "Smart Map" for the floor you're trying to clean, you can send room specific cleaning commands. The easiest way to find out the values for this is to start a room specific clean via the app, and then look at the `state` endpoint (documented below) and find the `lastCommand` entry. Using this, you can find the room ids. These seem to be stable over time, unless a re-training or new smart map is saved.

The `pmap_id` and `user_pmapv_id` are also derived from the same `lastCommand` trick. These also seem to be stable - unless a new training run or edit to the smart map happens. It's important to get these correct, else your roomba won't clean.


```sh
curl -X POST http://192.168.1.110:3000/api/local/action/cleanRoom -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"ordered": 0, "pmap_id": "123456", "regions": [{"region_id":"5", "region_name":"Hallway","region_type":"hallway"}], "user_pmapv_id": "987654"}'
```

> Note that this is a `POST` becuase it has a body, unlike the other related `action` methods.


### Info

All info endpoints are under `/api/local/info/[record]` using GET method without query params:

Available records:

- mission
